# DigitalBusCardQR
A vCard is a digital business card that you can share with someone instantly. A vCard QR code is a QR code that allows users to scan the QR code and add your business information immediately to their contacts. Instead of adding QR codes on business cards, you can use the QR code to be your business card.
